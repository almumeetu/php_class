<?php 

/* 
* With PHP, there are two basic ways to get output: echo and print.

* echo and print are more or less the same. They are both used to output data to the screen.

* The differences are small: echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions. echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument. echo is marginally faster than print.

*/




//Echo Statement:
/*
* The echo statements can be used with or without parenthees : echo or echo() .

echo "<h2>PHP is Fun!</h2>";
echo "Hello world!<br>";
echo "I'm about to learn PHP!<br>";
